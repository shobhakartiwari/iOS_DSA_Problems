# iOS DSA Problems

## 📌 Purpose
This repository is dedicated to solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems in Swift**, particularly for **iOS developers preparing for coding interviews**. Many iOS developers struggle with DSA topics, and this initiative aims to **bridge that gap** by providing **well-structured solutions, explanations, and best practices** in Swift.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?
Many iOS developers focus heavily on UI/UX and app development but often **struggle with algorithmic problem-solving** during technical interviews. The goal of this repository is to **help iOS engineers become confident in DSA** by:

- Providing **Swift-based solutions** for common DSA problems.
- Encouraging **daily problem-solving** for consistency.
- Helping iOS developers **develop a strong algorithmic mindset**.
- Offering **optimized and well-documented** code for better understanding.

## 📁 Repository Structure
This repository is structured to keep problems **organized and accessible**.

```
📂 iOS_DSA_Problems
│-- 📂 Arrays
│   │-- Problem1.swift
│   │-- Problem2.swift
│-- 📂 LinkedLists

```

Each folder contains problems **categorized by topic**, making it easier to navigate and focus on specific areas of improvement.

## 🚀 How to Contribute?
We **welcome contributions** from the iOS developer community! If you have a problem and solution to share:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your solution under the appropriate category.
3. Ensure the code is well-documented and optimized.
4. Create a pull request (PR) with a brief explanation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
If you want to **run and test** the problems locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iOS_DSA_Problems.git
   ```
2. Open Xcode and create a new **Playground**.
3. Copy and paste the problem file into the Playground.
4. Run and test the solution.
